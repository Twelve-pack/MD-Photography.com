		<h1>OUR SERVICE</h1>

		<p>The camera and photography were not invented by a single person, they developed in stages over a period of time. In the 12th century an image transferring device called the ‘camera obscura’ was used for the purpose of showing an image on plain paper so that it could be traced, this camera however did not take any pictures. In 1568 a lens was fitted to this camera, in 1802 the images from this camera were recorded and a contact print was made of the image, this print was however not permanent. In 1816 a crude photographic camera was developed, which allowed the making of a negative image.

It was only in 1839 that a man called William Fox Talbot was able to make permanent positives from negatives. In the year 1888 the camera was first sold commercially by the Eastman Dry Plate and Film Company.
